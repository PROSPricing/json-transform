## Todo

- apply constraint before or after source transformation
- functions should start from value node when it is not a container, e.g. FunctionSum
- $path object can have $structure
- $structure objects can have $append
- meta objects with $ transforms cannot be mingled with normal objects
- combination $path $expression does not work
